# Anti-Mask Twitter Network Analysis during the COVID Pandemic Era

## Motivation for the project
Since its inception, Social Media has been serving as a medium for spreading conspiracy theories, misinformation, and confusion and in recent times, Anti-vaccination movements have been gaining momentum since the approval of COVID vaccines. The individuals/communities who refuse to wear masks, typically do not believe in the effectiveness of masks and perceive it as a threat to their rights and some even believe that the COVID-19 pandemic is a hoax.
The influencers in such communities often aggravate the situation by strengthening negative hashtag trends and can potentially become a hazard to public health. Thus, as a responsible social media patform (i.e. Twitter) we analyze and try to understand of the network of anti-vaccination and anti-mask hashtags to determine an effective strategy to tackle these movements.
